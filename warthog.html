    <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
    <P>The warthog is a tough, sturdy animal. Males weigh 9 to 23 kilograms (20 to 50 pounds) more than females, but both are distinguished by disproportionately large heads and “warts” — thick protective pads that appear on both sides of the head. Their large tusks are unusual: the two upper tusks emerge from the sides of the snout to form a semicircle; the lower tusks, at the base of the uppers, are worn to a sharp-cutting edge. Sparse bristles cover their body, and longer bristles form a mane from the top of the head down the spine to the middle of the back. Their long tail ends with a tuft of bristles. Warthogs characteristically carry their tails upright when they run, the tuft waving like a tiny flag.</P>
    <P>Warthog Behavior The Warthog has adapted to be able to survive by grazing along the areas of the savanna. They rely on their snout to help them get food and they also use their front and back legs to dig. They tend to take over burrows that have been left behind by other animals though instead of digging their own when possible.</P>
