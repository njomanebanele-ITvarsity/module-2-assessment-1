    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
    <P>Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. The order was formerly much more diverse during the Pleistocene, but most species became extinct during the Late Pleistocene epoch. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs.</P>
<P>Elephants are the world’s largest land animal! Male African elephants can reach 3m tall and weigh between 4,000 -7,500kg. Asian elephants are slightly smaller, reaching 2.7m tall and weighing 3,000– 6,000kg.</P>
  <p>Elephants are some of the most intelligent and social animals on Earth. They can communicate with each other and learn quickly. Their behavior is fascinating and complex, and their range of emotions is astounding.
    Elephants are very curious and enjoy interacting with other animals and humans. They have a wide variety of behaviors, which is why their behavior is so fascinating.
    Elephants are known to be very peaceful creatures, but they can also be very aggressive if they feel threatened. Their complex social dynamics are something that scientists are still learning about</p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong> </p>
<P>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre</P>
